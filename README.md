# Amplify Graphql Transformer

This project shows how to generate configureable CDK stack from amplify transformers.

- Place the `graphql.schema` in `graphql/` (or `graphql/schema/` if you have more than one).
- ~~Run `yarn gen` or `tsc && node bin/app.js`.~~ (As of this commit, this doesn't work, check `src/app.ts`).
